# Touch CMD
A repository that contains every file and document I used in the master-test, to finish the HVA-minor 'Web Development'

## Goals
What do I want to achieve with this project, exactly? It's listed here:

- Build a unique experience for a large touchscreen interface
- Build a clean content management system in NodeJS

  
Before being able to create such a platform, I need to figure out what my priorities should be:

## Primary objectives
- CMS functionalities (Adding/Deleting: Pages, Menus, Types, Modules)
- Image upload
- Student portfolio - binding of work to a course
- Building views
- Adding content

## Secondary objectives
- CMS feedback
- Page transitions
- Animations
- Admin login data encryption
